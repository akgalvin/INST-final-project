# INST-final-project
This code is designed to process a file of text at the command line, and then take a word count and display the content of that rile. 
Enter the python code name, followed by the pathname of the txt.file. I included an example file to use. 
The code will process the text file by opening and reading the file, then it utilizes a string method to make a list of the words within the file. It will return a tuple which displays the word count and what the file says. 
If the user experiences an error, such as if the file is not found or other exceptions, error messages will be revealed which provides the user insight into what the error is. 
The path name must be accurate and within the correct directory for this code to work.
